Can you feel life moving through your mind
Looks like it came back for more - yeah
Can you feel time slipping down your spine
You try and try to ignore, yeah
But you can hardly swallow
Your fears and pain
When you can't help but follow
It puts you right back where you came
Live and learn
Hangin' on to the edge of tomorrow
Live and learn
From the works of yesterday
Live and learn
If you beg or if you borrow
Live and learn
You may never find your way
Can you feel life tangle you up inside (yeah!)
And now your face down on the floor, oh
But you can't save your sorrow
You've paid in trade
When you can't help but follow
It puts you right back where you came
Live and learn
Hangin' on to the edge of tomorrow
Live and learn
From the works of yesterday
Live and learn
If you beg or if you borrow
Live and learn
You may never find your way
There's a face searching far, so far and wide
There's a place where you dreamed you'd never find
Hold on to what if...
Hold on to what if...
Live and learn
Hangin' on to the edge of tomorrow
Live and learn
From the works of yesterday
Live and learn
If you beg or if you borrow
Live and learn
You may never find your way
Live and learn
Hangin' on to the edge of tomorrow
Live and learn
From the works of yesterday
Live and learn
If you beg or if you borrow
Live and learn
You may never find your way
Live and learn
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Live and learn
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
